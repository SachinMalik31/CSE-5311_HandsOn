**Q2:    " Time vs n " plot**

 In the plot generated using the provided data for "time vs n."

       i. The blue circles represent the actual measured times.
      ii. The red dashed line shows the quadratic polynomial fit to the data.

 As expected, the plot shows an upward curve, indicating a quadratic growth pattern consistent with the  𝑂(𝑛^2)  time complexity


**Q6 : Merge Sort** 

_Explanation of Code_ : 

**Merge Function:**     Merges two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.

**Merge Sort Function:**  Recursively divides the array into halves and sorts them.

**Main Function**:   Tests the merge sort on the array [5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6].



_Testing the Code_ :

Run the program in your preferred Java environment

**Original Array:** [5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6]

**Sorted Array:** [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
